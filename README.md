## How to use Editable List

### Setup Instruction

2. Change default settings to suit your needs
 - Target Object: Object to query and display

- Rows: Maximum Number of records to query and display  
  Be aware that it will have performance drawbacks if you have too many items (columns Ã— rows)
- Order:  Order is determined by adding 1 to that of the component which passes the search result to this component  
(For example, if you just use Search Box and Editable List, set 1 for Search Box and 2 for Editable List)

- 200 is the maximum number of rows
- Address, Formula, Combobox, Multipicklist, Location, and some other data types are not supported
